Certainly! Below is a README file template for your Git repository that explains how you've automated the creation of a VPC architecture using Terraform, including VPC, public subnets, Internet Gateway, Route Tables, Security Groups, and an Application Load Balancer (ALB).

# üöÄ Terraform Automated VPC Architecture

This repository demonstrates how to create a fully automated AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) architecture using Terraform. With this Terraform configuration, you can effortlessly provision the following AWS resources:

- VPC
- Public Subnets
- Internet Gateway
- Route Tables
- Security Groups
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)

![Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/assets/images/logo-hashicorp-3f10732f.svg)

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed on your local machine.
- AWS credentials configured, either through environment variables or `~/.aws/credentials`.

## üö¶ Getting Started

Follow these steps to deploy the AWS VPC architecture:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terraform-aws-vpc.git
   cd terraform-aws-vpc
   ```

2. **Initialize the Terraform workspace**:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Review and Configure Variables**:

   Adjust the variables in `terraform.tfvars` to match your desired configuration.

4. **Plan and Apply**:

   Execute Terraform to create the infrastructure:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

   Confirm the action by typing `yes` when prompted.

5. **Access Resources**:

   Once the infrastructure is provisioned, you can access the resources via AWS Console or CLI.

## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Overview

This Terraform project automates the creation of the following AWS resources:

- **VPC**: Isolated network environment.
- **Public Subnets**: Subnets with Internet access.
- **Internet Gateway**: Provides a path for traffic to the Internet.
- **Route Tables**: Control the traffic between subnets and the Internet.
- **Security Groups**: Define inbound and outbound traffic rules.
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Distributes traffic to EC2 instances.

## üßê Usage

- Access EC2 instances via SSH or HTTP.
- Monitor the infrastructure using AWS services.
- Modify the Terraform code to customize the architecture.
- Expand the architecture with additional resources.

## üßπ Cleaning Up

To destroy the infrastructure and release AWS resources:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

Confirm the action by typing `yes` when prompted.
